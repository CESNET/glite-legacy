LB proxy usage
==============

LB proxy accepts LB events, passes them to the full-featured LB servers, and
serves both event and job state queries similarly to the LB server. However,
the results of the queries reflect ONLY LOCAL VIEW of the proxy, i.e. the
events that were logged through it, not regarding other events which may affect
job state too. On the other hand, all the LB proxy operation is synchronous,
i.e.  it is guaranteed that a successfully logged event is visible in a query
result immediately, unlike the standard LB logging chain.

LB proxy is supposed to run on the RB machine, providing the WMS daemons
with optimal LB performance, while offloading the user LB queries to
a dedicated LB server.

Events are logged to the LB proxy through local UNIX socket. The connection to
the LB proxy is not encrypted, and no SSL-like authentication/authorisation is
used, relying completely on UNIX security mechanism.  Because of the missing
SSL authentication the logging user identity has to be specified explicitely
via LB proxy API.

Due to the synchornous operation LB proxy can help with management of LB
sequence codes. It records the most recent sequence code which can be retrieved
and used later, even by another WMS component. However, this mechanism works
for the "one job instance at time" model only. Once multiple instances of the
same job may co-exist (which may be the case of shallow resubmission), these
are distinguished exactly with the LB seqence code, hence LB proxy cannot
do the job. For this case LB proxy API still provides means of specifying
the sequence code explicitely.

All jobs are recorded localy in the LB proxy database until job gets into
CLEARED, ABORTED, CANCELED, DONE state. These jobs are then purged from LB
proxy (but they are still available on the LB server).
>>A timeout should be set also, after which job should be purged from LB proxy.
This has to be done by external purge client. <<

LB proxy uses same API functions for consumer and producer as LB does except the
function names are postfixed with 'Proxy'. I.e. edg_wll_SetLoggingJob()
has its own LB proxy variant edg_wll_SetLoggingJobProxy().

Other important difference is in edg_wll_SetLoggingJobProxy(), where it is not
neccessary to give the sequence code parameter. If user do not specify it, LB
proxy gets the actual one from its database. The 'user' attribute of this call
should be the user certificate DN string. If not set, it is set from the unix
environment by default.
